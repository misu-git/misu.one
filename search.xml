(Finney was also the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction).</p><p>Many other cryptocurrencies are based on proof of work, which allows for secure, decentralized consensus. </p><p>This discussion will concentrate on how proof of work works in the bitcoin network.<br>Bitcoin is a digital money that is supported by a “blockchain,” which is a type of distributed ledger.</p><p>This ledger keeps track of all bitcoin transactions and organizes them into “blocks” so that no user may spend the same amount of bitcoin twice.</p><p>The ledger is public, or “distributed,” to avoid manipulation; an altered version would be rapidly rejected by other users. </p><p>In practice, users identify tampering using hashes, which are long strings of numbers that act as proof of work.</p><p>When you run a set of data through a hash function (SHA-256 is used in Bitcoin), it will only ever produce one hash.</p><p>However, due to the “avalanche effect,” even little changes to any part of the original data will result in a hash that is completely unrecognizable.</p><p>The hash created by a given function will be the same length regardless of the size of the underlying data set.</p><p>The hash function is a one-way function: it can only be used to verify that the data that created the hash matches the original data. </p><p>For a modern computer, generating any hash for a set of bitcoin transactions would be cheap, thus the bitcoin network sets a particular level of “difficulty” to transform the process into “work.”</p><p>This option is changed such that a new block is “mined” – that is, added to the blockchain by creating a valid hash – every 10 minutes or so.</p><p>The complexity of a hash is determined by its “target”: the lower the target, the narrower the set of valid hashes and the more difficult it is to construct one.</p><p>In practice, this means a hash with a long string of zeros at the beginning. </p><h1 id="More-you-know"><a href="#More-you-know" class="headerlink" title="More you know"></a>More you know</h1><p>Proof of work was first offered as a response to the rising problem of spam email. </p>]]></content>
